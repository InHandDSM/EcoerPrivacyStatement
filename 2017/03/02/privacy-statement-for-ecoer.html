<p><strong>What information does the Ecoer Air Conditioner and Ecoer Air Conditioner Gateway collect?</strong></p>

  <li>Data from the Ecoer Air Conditioner’s sensors</li>
  <li>Heating and cooling usage information</li>
  <li>Technical information from the device</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>Setup information of air conditioners</u></strong>: The contractor will setup the devices when he install the Ecoer Air Conditioner. Ecoer Air Conditioner Gateway will collect these setup infomations in order to monitor the contractor’s work, make sure the air conditioner is working properly, and keep you comfortable.</p>

<p><strong><u>Data from the Ecoer Air Conditioner’s sensors</u></strong>: We collect data from several sensors built into the Ecoer Air Conditioner. These sensors collect data such as temperature, pressure in the Ecoer Air Conditioner. Ecoer Air Conditioner Gateway collects these data in order to monitor machine operation, analyze and report failures, analyze energy efficiency and do other functions to keep you comfortable.</p>

<p><strong><u>Heating and cooling usage information</u></strong>: Every time your system turns on and off, Ecoer records the time and duration during which your system was on in order to offer you features such as usage history.</p>

<p><strong><u>Technical information from the device</u></strong>: In order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with the Ecoer Air Conditioner , we record your Ecoer Air Conditioner model and serial number, software version, and technical information such as compressor speed.</p>

<p><strong>What information does Ecoer Assistant App collect?</strong></p>

<p>Ecoer Assistant is a mobile app offered by Ecoer to the contractors. Before installing Ecoer Air Conditioner Gateway, the contractors will show you this privacy statement, if you agree, please provide your personal information and sign it. Without your agreement, the Ecoer Air Conditioner Gateway will not be installed, no any infomation will be collected. Ecoer will use this information to provide you with after-sales service. These personal information includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your name</li>
  <li>Your home address</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How does Ecoer use the information it collects?</strong></p>

<p>We use this information to provide, develop and improve Ecoer Products and services, including to make assessments and recommendations about products, safety, or energy use. We may use your contact details to send you this information, or to ask you to participate in surveys about your Ecoer use, and to send you other communications from Ecoer.</p>

<p>We may also use this information in an aggregated, non-identified form for research purposes and to help us make sales, marketing, and business decisions. For example, we use aggregated user information about the number of active air conditioner users in a particular state to help us decide what energy companies might be good partners.</p>

<p>We may use service providers to perform some of these functions. Those service providers are restricted from sharing your information for any other purpose.</p>

<p>We use industry-standard methods to keep this information safe and secure while it is transmitted over your home network and through the Internet to our servers. Depending on your location and type of data, Ecoer may process your personal information on servers that are not in your home country.</p>

<p><strong>In what circumstances does Ecoer share my information?</strong></p>

<p>Under no circumstance do we share personal information for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the activation and delivery of Ecoer Products and services without asking you first. Period. We do not rent or sell our customer lists.</p>

<p>The following are the limited situations where we may share personal information:</p>

<p>With your explicit consent: We may share personal information when we have your consent. One example of this is if you sign this privacy statement, it shows that you agree the Ecoer Air Conditioner Gateway to collect infomations, and agree Ecoer to push maintenance information to the contractors. Maintenance information may include your personal information. Another example of this would be if you use service from a third party energy company, which works with Ecoer. We may share your personal information to the third party energy company.</p>

<p>For external processing: We have vendors, service providers, and technicians who help with some of our processing and storage, including helping to answer your questions. They may also assist with monitoring our servers for technical problems. These technicians (as well as Ecoer employees) can access certain information about you or your account in line with this work but these technicians are not allowed to use this data for non-Ecoer purposes.</p>

<p>As part of business transitions: Upon the sale or transfer of the company and/or all or part of its assets, your personal information may be among the items sold or transferred. We will request a purchaser to treat our data under the privacy statement in place at the time of its collection.</p>

<p>For legal reasons: We may provide information to a third party if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so for legal reasons. For example, we may disclose information in response to legal process and we may disclose information in response to lawful requests by public authorities in the United States and other countries for the purposes of law enforcement and national security.</p>

<p>We may share non-personal information (for example, aggregated or anonymized customer data) publicly and with our partners. For example, we may publish trends about energy use or elevated carbon monoxide levels in the home. This information may also be shared with other users to help them better understand their energy usage compared to others in the Ecoer community, raise awareness about safety issues, or help us generally improve our system. We may also share non-personal information with our partners, for example, if they are interested in providing demand-response services or other incentive programs. We take steps to keep this non-personal information from being associated with you and we require our partners to do the same.</p>

<p>If you select an outside party for the purchase, installation, or service of your Ecoer device and share your personal information, we cannot control the collection, storage or sharing of information collected by that party. For example, if you buy a Ecoer Learning Thermostat from a retailer, the retailer may collect personal information as part of the transaction. Or the party that installed the device may retain information that you provided to them to assist them in servicing the device if needed. Always check the privacy policies for any company that collects your personal information.</p>

<p>**How long does Ecoer save my personal information? **</p>

<p>Ecoer generally stores your personal information on Ecoer’s servers as long as you remain a Ecoer customer in order to provide you with Ecoer Products.</p>

<p>All personal information is encrypted as it is transmitted to Ecoer and cannot easily be accessed.</p>

<p><strong>How does Ecoer protect my personal information when it is transferred internationally?</strong></p>
